# Printing

Printing to standard output is done with the print keyword.It has a simple call syntax: the keyword print, followed by a space, followed by a valid expression. All of the basic data types are intelligently printable, except functions. 'print' automatically appends a newline at the end of the expression to print.

```
// classic hello world
print "Hello world!"
```
