# Data Types and Dynamic Typing

There are 5 supported basic data types. They are:

**Numbers**, **Strings**, **Boolean**, **Arrays**, **Functions**

Numbers are any numerical value. Strings are delimited by double-quotes. Boolean values can be either (unquoted) 'true' or 'false'. Arrays are created with the 'array()' built-in function and manipulated by a set of built in functions documented below. Functions are closures that can be passed around like a normal value and can be called with arguments at any time with the familiar 'function(arg1, arg2)' syntax.

Each type can be directly assigned to a variable, including functions. Variables are dynamically typed so a variable can be assigned to different data types in its lifetime. Type coercing is not fully supported except for those documented in the operator section below, and may behave arbitrarily.
